📚 Library Data Analysis Project

This project leverages the power of NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform deep data analysis and create impactful visualizations. The dataset is carefully cleaned and preprocessed — missing or null values are efficiently handled to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

Key analytical highlights include:

🔝 Identification of the Top 5 Customers based on total purchases.

🎵 Discovery of the Top 5 Genres preferred by readers.

🥧 Pie Chart illustrating Total Sales Distribution per Genre.

📅 Histogram displaying the Publication Year Distribution for insights into book release trends.

🚫 Identification of books that didn’t receive any orders, helping optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

With clear visual storytelling through Matplotlib, this project transforms raw library data into meaningful insights about customer behavior, sales performance, and literary trends — empowering smarter business and marketing decisions.
